# Python-Project
Project implements the libraries, 'socket' and 'datetime'

Script accepts 3 inputs:
    1 for the user to input a host address or IP
    1 for the user to input the beginning port
    1 for the user to input the ending port

The script will output "---" for each port scanned, to show that the code is continuing to run

Address scanned, time of running the script, time at which scan began and ended, time elapsed for the entire port scan, and any opened ports are written to a text file in the same directory titled 'Port Scan'

Try-exception is implemented to handle errors if there are any invalid inputs
