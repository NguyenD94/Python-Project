# Python-Project
Project implements the libraries, 'socket' and 'datetime'

Script accepts 3 inputs:
    1 for the user to input a host address or IP
    1 for the user to input the beginning port
    1 for the user to input the ending port

The script will output "---" for each port scanned, to show that the code is continuing to run

Any opened ports are written to a text file

Try-exception is implemented to handle errors if there are any invalid inputs
